How to setup 3mik stack
----------------------------------


1) Get VMWARE to install VMs. VMs would allow you to play and experiment without touching your own machine.
    windows - Just download and install vmware player http://www.vmware.com/products/player
    Mac - VMWARE Fusion
    
2)
Get a linux VM - For a desktop either install 
    * LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition)
    * Ubuntu Natty 

   You can pick our own distro if you can manage your own stuff and not cry for help.
   Do a Vanilla (plain) install (Just select all defaults)

3) Install  git on your machine
    open a terminal and type:-
    $sudo aptitude install git-core git git-man

4) Git setup
 ------------------------------------

A) first do a bit of reading if you are not familiar with Git.
    https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
    https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
    https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
    http://git-scm.com/book

    You can also read the online git book to understand git work flows and how is it different from 
    other centralized SCM you may have used in past


B) create an account on Github
   https://github.com/ 

C) send your username to Rajeev Jha to be added to our private repo.
D) Fork our private repository hosted here:- 
    https://github.com/rjha/sc
    @see article #3 above.

E) clone this forked repository (the one with your name and __not_the_one__ above in step D)
like:
    + first create a folder to hold code. Better to follow standard layout
    + $ mkdir -p $HOME/code/github
    + $ cd $HOME/code/github
    + setup your github account to use SSH keys like explained in article #2 above.
    + git clone <your forked repo link> 
        imp : take the link that starts with git and uses SSH and do not take the one with https://
    + Verify that $HOME/code/github/sc indeed contains code and you have files.

F) Do not push anything to repo. Do whatever on your own machine. issue fetch, pull etc. 
G) setup my (main) repository as upstream  
    $ cd $HOME/code/github/sc
    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:rjha/sc.git
    $ git fetch upstream master
    $ git pull upstream master

H) To get changes from one of upstream branches
    create a local branch to receive it
    $git branch redis
    switch to this branch
    $git checkout redis
    pull changes from upstream redis branch here
    $git fetch upstream redis
    $git pull upstream redis

I) install webgloo public repository
---------------------------------------
This is a public repository, install it at the same level as sc repository.
Like if your home directory is /home/foo (i.e. $HOME)
Then /home/foo/code/github/sc is where sc repository is installed.
To install webgloo repository

$cd $HOME/code/github
$git clone git://github.com/rjha/webgloo.git

Now you should have
 /home/foo/code/github
    |_ sc/
    |_ webgloo/


Read the git book to know how to switch between branches etc.
Now you are ready to receive changes from my repostitory.


5) set packages required for development
--------------------------------------------

please look in $HOME/code/github/sc/deploy/packages folder.
follow the instructions in aptitude.bulk.install file.
The filename will depend on your type of install, e.g.
for installation on a desktop - use wheezy.desktop.packages file, like

$ sudo aptitude --simulate install $(< wheezy.desktop.packages)
$sudo aptitude install $(< wheezy.desktop.packages)

The only interaction is to provide root password for mysql.
provide any password you like. save the mysql root password for later use.


6)cd $HOME/code/github/sc/deploy
open ubuntu-vm.sh script
@imp: set your home dir path on top
save and quit file.

$chmod +x ./ubuntu-vm.sh
$sudo ./ubuntu-vm.sh

run the ubuntu-vm.sh script as root to create the development layout. 

@imp: If there are any other complaints then the script is failing and script should be fixed first.
moving ahead will only cause agony.


7) Add mint.3mik.com as host 
$sudo vim /etc/hosts
Add an entry for mint.3mik.com 127.0.0.1

8)

8) Check :: Verify PHP install and layout
Now open a browser and type :-
http://mint.3mik.com/echo.php

@imp: This should show your path and loaded modules etc.  
If things work then we are ready to move onto next step, else we need to fix things here first.


9) create mysql database and load data from server.
@see $HOME/code/github/sc/deploy/mysql/mysql.install

10)install and configure sphinx. create sphix indexes.
@see $HOME/code/github/sc/deploy/sphinx/sphinx.install


11) Get a copy of latest sc-app.inc and sc_config.ini file (Ask Rajeev Jha) 

These files can vary for different branches as well!

checklist local sc_config.ini file
    - change mysql user password
    - change log and other location  
    - change file.store to local
    - change session.backend to mysql (or redis)
    - sensitive information (like sendgrid password, FB App Id etc. is removed)


copy the files to 
$sudo cp <file> /var/www/apps/.

12) Reboot your machine.

Now http://mint.3mik.com should show you local copy of 3mik site.

13) install cron scripts
@wip
14) install logrotate script
@wip
15) install redis server
@wip
