#To create a new user on server
$sudo adduser rjha
#To reset password for a user

$sudo passwd <username>

You also have to allow the user in sshd. AllowUsers add with a space like
#vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

port 22001 (from 22)
Add as last line in sshd_config (we do not want someone to try logins)
AllowUsers rjha

#restart the SSH daemon
$sudo service ssh restart
