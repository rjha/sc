session 
--------

To use your own custom session implementation we provide two classes
1. Redis based
2. mySQL based


sc_config.ini
--------------
session.backend=mysql|redis|default
;time in seconds
session.lifetime=3600 

php.ini
-----------

session.gc_probability=0


Caveats
---------

+ cookie lifetime is important. If we do not set rolling expiry on cookie then 
after browser close, there is no cookie, we have to generate a new session_id and start 
a new session. This rolling expiry on session cookie is set inside web/inc/mysql-session.inc file.

+ Donot write sessions to DB if we donot have any session data (if we have not stored anything)
We do a session_start() in header so a session is started. However we can simply return from the 
session_write() call if we donot have session_data.

+ set session.gc_probability=0 inside fpm/php.ini.
This will ensure that default sessions are cleared via ubuntu /etc/cron.d/php5 script.
To clear mysql stale sessions - we can use a cron job.
There is no need to clear redis based sessions - As we set an expiry on keys 
Redis will automatically clean these keys after expiry


+ To manually clean redis sessions : we can 

 * find keys using command "keys sc:PHPSESSID:*"
 * for all such we can issue a DEL KEY command
 * we can also find the time left for such keys via TTL command 


concurrent access to session data
------------------------------------
for mysql based session backend we open a Tx inside session_open and 
commit the Tx inside session_close. PHP session data is read at the start of page execute
and is flushed at the end. Therefore it is important that no modifications to session data 
happen before my page exits. 

One page - One sessionId - One Tx
 - get lock
 - read data
 - write data 
 - release lock
