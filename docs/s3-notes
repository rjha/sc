+ why are we using a modified version of aws sdk-1.5.7?
	 @issue with sdk-1.5.7 : the script will complain about bad SSL certificate,
     whether you use in-built cert  (true) or use one from your system (false)
     Right now the only way to make that work is to shut off SSL in sdk-1.5.7/service/s3.class.php
     file at @line 552.
     
     552 $scheme = $this->use_ssl ? 'https://' : 'http://';
     553 $scheme =  'http://';

+ where can I find a tarball of this modified sdk version?
	- on 108.166.123.14 machine. look under $HOME/s3 folder.


+ How to view caching header on a 3mik.com image that we download in browser

 - chrome | open developer console | network tab
 - or click on inspect an element | click network tab | keep the console open
 - Now load a new page (not seen in this browser)
 - sort on response - look for image with 200 response code
 - click on Image - right hand side - select headers
 - look @ response headers
 - look @ expired field
 - something like Expires:Mon, 20 May 2013 04:40:16 GMT


+ How to change the headers on an object
 - see db/s3/s3-add-cache script

+ How to enable versioning on a bucket
	- see db/s3/s3-add-versioning.php
+ How to list versions of objects
	@todo - the get_object_headers only returns the last version

+ Does changing headers count as a new version?
	- yes. when you change header using copy_object API call
	- the version is also changed.

+ is it a good idea to enable versioning on media1.3mik.com?
 No. Better idea is to copy the objects to a bucket in singapore region.
 Run an aws EC2 machine and copy objects as they become available.
 Run this script as a cron JOB on EC2 worker machine.
