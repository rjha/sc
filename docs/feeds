feeds data in redis
------------------------

* we should be able to generate all feed data from mysql
* we should move old data for archival purposes in mysql
* redis should keep new feed data for quick retrieval
* in mysql - keeping fan-out data - would mean lot of duplication
  it is better stored in redis with lists/hashs and sets




operation: Add follower
-----------------------------

 - Add to global feeds
 - Add to global jobs

 - Add to user:1:activities list 
 - Add to user:1:feeds list
 - Add to user:1:followers set

*difference between feeds and activities*

feed is what the user should "receive" as he is following 
other users and to get news of his interest.

activity is what the user does it himself. activity should go to
user public profile page. feed is what appears on user account 
page.
