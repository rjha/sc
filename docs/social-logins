# FB access_token validity and its impact on 3mik sessions


Problem: facebook access tokens obtained via server side auth are valid for 60 days. The 3mik
login is valid for 7 days. However on 8th day, when you redirect the user to 3mik login page and 
use is taken through FB authentication flow, Facebook __will not__ issue a new access token or refresh the 
expires value. Facebook will issue the same access token that it issued 7 days back and with same expires
value. 

3mik login on day 1 - FB access token A - expire after 60 days
3mik login on day 8 - FB access token A - expire after 53 days

3mik logout or clearing of session on 3mik server - will not result in a new FB access token unless 
user does something in his browser. Till this access token expires on 60th day, Facebook will not 
relaunch the auth dialog and will not issue a new token. 

It __does not look possible__ to extend the expiry of this access token without user intervention.
(Like issuing a request to some graph API w/o the auth Dialog) So Facebook access token expiry date 
is not "rolling" with each new 3mik login.  

Impact : The facebook access token will expire on 60th day from the first issue.
3mik login on 57th day - FB Access token A - 3mik login valid till 63rd day.
3mik login on 61st day - login valid - FB access token has expired. So we get an error even though 
user has a valid 3mik session going on.


Solution:

+ Try to clear the job that writes to FB Feed
	
	- nuke if job is more than X days old	
	- leave the job in queue if there is no access_token 
	
	- There is an acess_token
		* check if access_token.expire_on > now()
		* check if you get "has expired" error when using this access_token  
			- clear out the access token 
			- clear out the user session in mysql DB


# we cannot log out the user from Facebook.
So how do we make the user obtain a new facebook access token?

# FB Reauthentication ( http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/reauthentication/ ) generates
a new access_token but the expire_on remains the same.

#How to Extend the expiration of access tokens?
Does not look possible w/o launching auth dialog.

# debug a facebook access token 
https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/access_token

# customize extended permissions message
  - if our app is accepted in Facebook App center then we can display a customized message
    what appears on App details page. However if app is not in app center then we keep showing
    the default message that is quite scary.


# launch a dialog to get extended permissions after authorization
- https://www.facebook.com/dialog/permissions.request?app_id=&
- using FB login social plugin trick
- launching oauth dialog via javascript (what we have in callback)

Launching fbDialogURL (what we use on login page with extra scope parameters should do the trick!)


#fixing  facebook dialog popup

see the old item page share on Facebook popup on how to open the FB dialog in a popup 
instead of in a separate page. Beware that it does not make sense to open oAuth dialog in a
popup as we redirect back to a URL that will replace the popup window. (Unless we close popup window on redirect)
