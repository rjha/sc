IE issue with file upload
----------------------------

Turns out it was actually a PHP issue. (The way we handle data coming from file uploader in PHP script)
https://github.com/valums/file-uploader/issues/352
it is better to use the code from github now as it is being maintained.

version update
----------------

The sc code will 18 oct. 2012 was using valums file uploader downloaded from old site.

19th Oct. 2012 - we planned to move to the version of file uploader maintained on github
https://github.com/valums/file-uploader
This is in hope to fix bug fixes etc.
we are deploying version 2.1.1

However working with file uploader means making some changes to the default release.
Unfortunately ful is not very plug-in like. so we hack the core library itself.
This may be a good thing or this may be a bad thing. The original files are left in repo
so you can take a diff anytime and see the changes. (Use meld to see the diff)

css changes
---------------

- removed qq-upload-button style
- removed qq-upload-drop-area style
- qq-upload-list : copied from old valums plugin (basically no background and smaller fonts)
- qq-upload-success and qq-upload-fail styles changes
(we want black on white and red on white styles)

sc.css - no overriding is required for file uploader.

js changes
------------------

* old valums - we changed the template used to create upload button
    - add bootstrap style "btn" to qq-upload-button
    - added a custom label 

* 2.1.1 release from github
    - Button name can be supplied as an option (uploadButtonText)
    - removed progress bar rendering code (Not needed and I believe the computation is also off)
    - progress bar interferes with rendering of cancel button 
    - As usual added btn class to upload button template
