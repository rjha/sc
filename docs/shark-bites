Redis max memory
--------------------

1) redis max memory size is 64 MB - if keys take more than 64 MB then we will run out of memory
check redis memory consumption using info command on redis-cli


session Tx
---------------
The PHP session is a mysql backed session. for default implementation of _SESSION what this means is that 
we open a Tx at top and commit it at the end. Hence long running scripts can result in deadlocks.
