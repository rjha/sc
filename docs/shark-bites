Redis max memory
--------------------

redis max memory size is 64 MB - if keys take more than 64 MB then we will run out of memory
check redis memory consumption using info command on redis-cli


session Tx
---------------
The PHP session is a mysql backed session. for default implementation of _SESSION what this means is that 
we open a Tx at top and commit it at the end. Hence long running scripts can result in deadlocks.

s3 bucket objects caching header
--------------------------------
when we upload images in an s3 bucket - we set the caching header to expire after 1 year
(RFC recommends 365 days, not sure if > 365 days will be honored)
That means we need to update caching headers (metadata for s3 objects)
after one year. Please see s3-notes for more details.
