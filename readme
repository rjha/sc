fix db filter

08 May 2012

@todo Test
 + login 
 + registration
 + FB registration
 + Twitter registration
 + Post create 
 + Group process(site-worker.sh)
 +3mik registration (success + error) 
 + Test $pdo->exec errors : I suspect they do not throw errors - Group Process has to be redone now!
 throwing exception depends on PDO settings. we do get errors from $dbh->execute. The error code mechanism is more for cases when you do not throw exception.

@todo Code 

1) Better log errors when site URL are bad like: UNKNOWN_URL_PATTERN
2) - Mix photos with group browsing?
3) Faceboo router => should detect scripts ending in .php => important!
4) interest based search/browsing?
5) make sure that all pUrl and qUrl are not processed by our form hander - we need raw urls
Fix navigation for cancel button everywhere.
6)Form protection by inserting unique tokens  - PRG or DejaVu' pattern to avoid form resubmission
7) fix fancybox related errors in nginx 
8) sitemap - automatically generate every week
9) New item in Navigation Bar-  what can I do?
    - share
    - Ask
    - Answer
10) MySQL session support - move to PDO / remove REPLACE with UPSERT
11) Sphinx delta indexing
12)Install a JOB queue for Async processes 
- Look @ Redis and Beanstalkd
- Async processes - registration /reset password mails , thumbnail creation
13) store thumbnail information in media files
14) Add correct file name (ending in .jpeg) for thumbnails
15) create ICU resource bundles with php-intl
16) fix DB filter creation - model on hibernate
17) Need to fix the profile page : Ask for more data
18) Redo all form scripts using exception handling bits
19) Edit page - user groups - open in cards instead of as cloud
20) Followers/Following page
21) Fix DB Errors - throw MySQLException from lower layers
22) Add pagination / filter / No record found messages everywhere (image?)
23) Post widget actions - feature/unfeature
24) Error page display fix - new page maybe?
25) interest based browsing?
