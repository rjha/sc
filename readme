- make sure that all pUrl and qUrl are not processed by our forms - we need raw forms?
- change noprocess to raw? recheck noprocess implementation - it may not work the way we want it to
- better keep q.url and p.url in _SESSION? I think so 
- implement lock for site processing 
  - The standard unix trick of using a wrapper shell script to check for process name 
    is good enough to prevent multiple running scripts
