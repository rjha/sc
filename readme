#phpcs is freaking verbose and not at all useful
# php -l : only for uninitialized variables etc
# pfff/scheck : does not detect as well
# How about hiphop's static analysis?
# rips - code is object oriented and not supported

phpmd rocks!

use the first one to detect errors, use the second one with design to get design advices as well.

---------------------------------
Add activities to home page
Activity - Add data for users and add to email queue also
Activity - distinguish no result (empty array() ) vs. error case (redis not up)
Activities - Add comment snippet (64 chars) and post stamp tile to activity feeds
Activity - Add time also
Activity - change follower and following Id to :- subjectId and objectId etc.
Activity - feed should not show duplicates.
Activity - post interest group :- people who are interested in one post
    => like : you comment on a post and someone likes it.
    => No comment : comment only.


redis - compile as 32 bit application to save key space.
redis - use 2.6 RC instead of 2.2 or 2.4?
redis - test deployment on ubuntu natty machine.

Data for activities
@imp:
script for sc_user_bookmark => sc_bookmrk data transfer
sc_bookmark  => load data into redis sets
sc_follow  => load data into redis sets



Automatic versioning of css and js files
pagination for redis.io List (LPUSH so slot 0 has latest item)
test webgloo.ui.pagination class
error checks :- simulated DBExceptions and real ones
Move all constants to sc\Constants file. e.g. FEATURE_POST
Add pub_id (or pseudo_id) column to for users and whatever uses pseudo_id




our filters - should apply type (e.g. int) based cast
filter - cannot be empty

Do we want to store form escaped data - e.g. single quote to &#039;
Spinx - better indexes - filter on index
placeholder image on site/go-static and automatic pages
Nice feedback from ajax scripts

Reload ajax action that was disrupted by login screen
group: Alphabetical push buttons instead of Alpha bar that we have right now.
Help content
supercow button for admins
Capture additional data for sites / Items
+ All UNIQ Key errors: check in UI via Ajax before hitting DB
+ Add caching headers to old S3 images

User dashboard - followers/following page.
Pagination on monitor app/user dashboard


@later
-------------------------
mysql innodb tuning
sitemap - automatically generate every week
Better sharing with friends and social networks
json_enocde and json_deocde error checks everywhere with json_error_last
file upload - more than 256 chars in name ?
Async processes - registration /reset password mails , thumbnail creation
Capture use activity
Redis for session and async job processing
Interest based browsing?
Mix photos with group browsing?
Sphinx delta indexing
Add SSL support for login page?
create ICU resource bundles with php-intl
Send tokens used for Sphinx queries
remove $_SERVER from everywhere
    - it should be possible to run our scripts using cli SAPI also




@done
------------------------
sphinx query.log as email attachment
shut off Nginx/PHP version  advertising
URL like http://www.3mik.com/group/beta.php should return nginx 404
PHP : No input file found exception
Turn off publicizing Nginx + PHP version
Fix thumbnail name issue
filter original image names to weed out malformed input
Mysql  session handler
Edit page - user groups - open in cards instead of as cloud
fix DB filter creation - model on hibernate
Better log errors when site URL are bad like: UNKNOWN_URL_PATTERN
Url.php @line78
Fix fancybox related errors in nginx
Faceboo router => should detect scripts ending in .php => important!
fix bug in random groups :- include Navigation
All ajax scripts should be protected by login
Form protection by inserting unique tokens  - PRG or DejaVu' pattern to avoid form resubmission
 Not required everywhere :- we do not have public forms
 Login protected forms are fine.

make sure that all pUrl and qUrl are not processed by our form hander - we need raw urls
Fix navigation for cancel button everywhere.
Login with google

Fix user dashboard
 - Need to fix the profile page : Ask for more data
 - Add denorm_user

error page - stop encoding the messages
SQL injection : look @ all queries again please!

Sphinx searchd not starting on debian machines
 fixed: changed init.d boot script to be compatible with insserv
        you have to add the right run levels in LSB headers
Sphix logs not rotating?
 fixed:Need to send SIGUSR1 signal to searchd


Template functions :- do not call in a loop (file open/close every time)
    It should be faster to put the loop inside template file itself.
    problem : we need to call different templates based on  text/image data.
    That will not work with moving everything inside a template.

MYSQL error handling : cleanup / throwing exceptions / do not trigger errors
    => we may want to handle some DB Exceptions
    => remove DBExceptions from UI code.

URL tampering => we should not error out on bad params or URL
put sphinx mysql connector IP and port in config file.
