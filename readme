@todo 

pfff tool scheck to lint php codebase
URL tampering => should we include checksum everywhere?
URL tampering => we should not error out on bad params or URL
BUffered vs unbuffered queries with mysql
mysql innodb tuning 
our filters - should apply type (e.g. int) based cast
filter - cannot be empty
Do we want to store form escaped data - e.g. single quote to &#039;
Spinx - better indexes - index filtering
put sphinx mysql connector IP and port in config file.  
Redis server :- play with it
insert one screen in workflow after login -> Dashboard/3mik Home page choice
placeholder image on site/go-static and automatic pages
Nice feedback from ajax scripts
Reload ajax action that was disrupted by login screen
Automatic versioning of css and js files

+ How does sc_denorm_user update impact other tables and fields ? e.g. sc_login and sc_user
  can we allow users to change email? should we update email in sc_user ? I do not think so..
  Better idea is to make email box editable when we do not have email data readonly vs. writable box.
- URL/Blog :- add HTTP automatically!
- group: Alphabetical push buttons instead of Alpha bar that we have right now.
- When no results : Suggest things to user 
- After login - Take user to another page instead of Home page 
- Help content
- supercow button should be visible after admin login 
- Browsing options -  sites browsing 
+ All UNIQ Key errors: check in UI via Ajax before hitting DB
+ Add caching headers to old S3 images

Fix user dashboard
 - Help content on user dahsboard pages
 - following/followers
 - favorite - clicking on remove :- reload/refresh the page

+ Monitor App

monitor - Post widget actions - feature/unfeature
Supercow button on item details page
Pagination on monitor app/user dashboard

Form protection by inserting unique tokens  - PRG or DejaVu' pattern to avoid form resubmission

Fix navigation for cancel button everywhere.
