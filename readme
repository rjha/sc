Home page tile options :- change background color using

Fix error in feed - PseudoId - should throw exception??
Error in individual feed should be ignored!


move error handler inside a class now.
\com\indigloo\error\ErrorHandler
    - default
    - offline
    - gobble

ExceptionHandler
    - default
    - offline
    - gobble

Add default error and exception handler into inc/header.inc
//How to set object methods as error handler.
$error_handler = new Raven_ErrorHandler($client);
set_error_handler(array($error_handler, 'handleError'));
set_exception_handler(array($error_handler, 'handleException'));


remove session related header files
user/logout page - it just needs session_start() there - why the heck are we including 
inc/session.inc and is that not wrong when using mysql sessions?
check that out!



@bugs
---------------
mail reset - should only work for 3mik source
change password - should only work for 3mik source
No check for very long URL on item post.
User profile page - should show count of post.
Comment Box should inform about max chars - 512
Add follow button to user public profile.




@todo
-----------
+ Play with Gearman / offline jobs etc.
+ change sendgrid password
  #sendgrid#3mik#94
+ clean reset password table in site worker script
+ send mail on registration 
+ instead of mail reset password : make a general queue!
+ Better job queue.
+ Activity - Add time also
+ Activity - have a look again at the design - Right now one user can hogg the channel.
+ sphinx query.log analysis
+ redis - use test and stable - databases.
+ Activities should have paging.
+ test webgloo.ui.pagination class
+ Move all constants to sc\Constants file. e.g. FEATURE_POST
+ Add pub_id (or pseudo_id) column to for users and whatever uses pseudo_id
+ ui filters - should apply type (e.g. int) based cast
+ ui filter - cannot be empty

+ Do we want to store form escaped data - e.g. single quote to &#039;
+ Spinx - better indexes - filter on index
+ Nice feedback from ajax scripts
+ Reload ajax action that was disrupted by login screen
+ group: Alphabetical push buttons instead of Alpha bar that we have right now.
+ Help content
+ supercow button for admins
+ capture additional data for sites / Items
+ add caching headers to old S3 images
+ pagination on monitor app/user dashboard
+ use redis for storing user sessions?

sphinx delta indexing
async job processing

All UNIQ Key errors: check in UI via Ajax before hitting DB


@done
-----------------------------
use redis for activities
capture use activity
sitemap - new sitemap posted.
User dashboard - followers/following page.
Automatic versioning of css and js files
redis - compile as 32 bit application ? NO
redis - use 2.6 RC instead of 2.2 or 2.4? YES
shut off Nginx/PHP version  advertising
URL like http://www.3mik.com/group/beta.php should return nginx 404
PHP : No input file found exception
Turn off publicizing Nginx + PHP version
Fix thumbnail name issue
filter original image names to weed out malformed input
Mysql  session handler
Edit page - user groups - open in cards instead of as cloud

Url.php @line78
Fix fancybox related errors in nginx
Faceboo router => should detect scripts ending in .php => important!
fix bug in random groups :- include Navigation
All ajax scripts should be protected by login
Form protection by inserting unique tokens  - PRG or DejaVu' pattern to avoid form resubmission
 Not required everywhere :- we do not have public forms
 Login protected forms are fine.

make sure that all pUrl and qUrl are not processed by our form hander - we need raw urls
Fix navigation for cancel button everywhere.
Login with google

Fix user dashboard
 - Need to fix the profile page : Ask for more data
 - Add denorm_user

error page - stop encoding the messages
SQL injection : look @ all queries again please!

Sphinx searchd not starting on debian machines
 fixed: changed init.d boot script to be compatible with insserv
        you have to add the right run levels in LSB headers
Sphix logs not rotating?
 fixed:Need to send SIGUSR1 signal to searchd


Template functions :- do not call in a loop (file open/close every time)
    It should be faster to put the loop inside template file itself.
    problem : we need to call different templates based on  text/image data.
    That will not work with moving everything inside a template.

MYSQL error handling : cleanup / throwing exceptions / do not trigger errors
    => we may want to handle some DB Exceptions
    => remove DBExceptions from UI code.

URL tampering => we should not error out on bad params or URL
put sphinx mysql connector IP and port in config file.
