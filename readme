 - Better sharing with friends and social networks
 - supercow button
 - SQL injection : look @ all queries again please!
 - Fix - PHP : No input file found exception
 - Turn off publicizing Nginx + PHP version
 - why the heck sphinx query.log are of size zero??
 - image upload script :- should be protected by login
 - error when MediaVO does not contain the required attributes (examine in JavaScript)


 Fix thumbnail name issue:- 
    thumbnails are always jpeg files and their extension should change
    The way to do that is 
    1. Add column thumbnail_name to sc_media
    2. Run sql to fix the 9 posts for what we do not have data
    3. Run the fix-thumbnail-name-script
    4. Get a list of media ids and verify that they all have thumbnail_name 
    5. Upload new code

    
 - 9 images were screwed because of "single quote (') issue " 
   - Need to test more with strange image file names - we can simply filter such names
   - Just put an alphanumeric filter (or our SEO key converter) in front of what the browser supplies
   - Fix the broken images_json posts :- maybe override with '[]' ?
   - An example:- http://mint.3mik.com/item/203755 
   - Robust image error handling

@todo Test
 + login 
 + registration
 + FB registration
 + Twitter registration
 + Post create 
 + Group process(site-worker.sh)
 +3mik registration (success + error) 
 + Test $pdo->exec errors : I suspect they do not throw errors - Group Process has to be redone now!
 throwing exception depends on PDO settings. we do get errors from $dbh->execute. The error code mechanism is more for cases when you do not throw exception.

@todo Code 

14) Add correct file name (ending in .jpeg) for thumbnails
19) Edit page - user groups - open in cards instead of as cloud
20) Followers/Following page
22) Add pagination / filter / No record found messages everywhere (image?)
23) Post widget actions - feature/unfeature
1) Better log errors when site URL are bad like: UNKNOWN_URL_PATTERN
3) Faceboo router => should detect scripts ending in .php => important!
5) make sure that all pUrl and qUrl are not processed by our form hander - we need raw urls, Fix navigation for cancel button everywhere.
6)Form protection by inserting unique tokens  - PRG or DejaVu' pattern to avoid form resubmission
7) fix fancybox related errors in nginx 
8) sitemap - automatically generate every week
9) New item in Navigation Bar-  what can I do?
    - share
    - Ask
    - Answer
10) MySQL session support - move to PDO / remove REPLACE with UPSERT
13) store thumbnail information in media files
15) create ICU resource bundles with php-intl
16) fix DB filter creation - model on hibernate
17) Need to fix the profile page : Ask for more data
18) Redo all form scripts using exception handling bits


25) interest based browsing?
2) - Mix photos with group browsing?
11) Sphinx delta indexing
12)Install a JOB queue for Async processes 
- Look @ Redis and Beanstalkd
- Async processes - registration /reset password mails , thumbnail creation
21) Fix DB Errors - throw MySQLException from lower layers



24) Error page display fix - new page maybe?
